# open Graph Api

An API for open Cloud Collaboration.

This API is inspired by [Microsoft Graph API](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph).

## Goal

This projects goal is to provide an open source standard for open Cloud Collaboration.

## Specification

The API specification uses the OpenAPI Specification (OAS) standard.

The [OpenAPI Specification (OAS)](https://swagger.io/specification/) defines a standard, language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic.

An OpenAPI definition can then be used by documentation generation tools to display the API, code generation tools to generate servers and clients in various programming languages, testing tools, and many other use cases.
